TODO

- sudo/root support
- meaningful errors, warnings
- quiet/verbose toggle
- optionally suppress warnings
- syslogging
- daemon mode
- query status while in daemon mode

- Replication
  * Assign thrasher instances to a group. Whenever a log is seen with a holddown
    where the originating thrasher instances is within that group, send an
    inject packet to all other thrasher instances in that group.

- Handle route errors
  * exit code 1792 = failure
  * 'SIOCDELRT: No such process' = route does not exist
  * 'SIOCADDRT: File exists'     = route already exists

- Handle iptables errors:
  * As iptables does not check before adding a chain, so duplicates are possible,  
    we should probably check for those and skip them.
  * exit code 256 = failure
  * 'iptables: Bad rule (does a matching rule exist in that chain?' = chain already exists


DONE

- collect all activity and report them at end
